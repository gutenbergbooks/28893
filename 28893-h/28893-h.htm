Door, take but a single step, and&mdash;</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"In one</span> fell swoop," declared
Professor C. Cydwick Ohms, releasing
a thin blue ribbon of pipe-smoke
and rocking back on his
heels, "&mdash;I intend to solve the
greatest problem facing mankind
today. Colonizing the Polar Wastes
was a messy and fruitless business.
And the Enforced Birth Control
Program couldn't be enforced.
Overpopulation still remains the
thorn in our side. Gentlemen&mdash;"
He paused to look each of the
assembled reporters in the eye.
"&mdash;there is but <i>one</i> answer."</p>

<p>"Mass annihilation?" quavered
a cub reporter.</p>

<p>"Posh, boy! Certainly not!" The
professor bristled. "The answer is&mdash;TIME!"</p>

<p>"Time?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," nodded Ohms. With
a dramatic flourish he swept aside
a red velvet drape&mdash;to reveal a
tall structure of gleaming metal.
"As witness!"</p>

<p>"Golly, what's <i>that</i> thing?"
queried the cub.</p>

<p>"This <i>thing</i>," replied the professor
acidly, "&mdash;is the C. Cydwick
Ohms Time Door."</p>

<p>"Whillikers, a Time Machine!"</p>

<p>"Not so, not so. <i>Please</i>, boy! A
Time Machine, in the popular
sense, is impossible. Wild fancy!
However&mdash;" The professor tapped
the dottle from his pipe. "&mdash;by a
mathematically precise series of
infinite calculations, I have developed
the remarkable C. Cydwick
Ohms Time Door. Open it, take
but a single step&mdash;and, presto! The
Past!"</p>

<p>"But, <i>where</i> in the past, Prof.?"</p>

<p>Ohms smiled easily down at the
tense ring of faces. "Gentlemen,
beyond this door lies the sprawling
giant of the Southwest&mdash;enough
land to absorb Earth's overflow like
<i>that</i>!" He snapped his fingers. "I
speak, gentlemen, of Texas, 1957!"</p>

<p>"What if the Texans <i>object</i>?"</p>

<p>"They have no choice. The Time
Door is strictly a one-way passage.
I saw to that. It will be utterly impossible
for anyone in 1957 to re-enter
our world of 2057. And now&mdash;the
Past awaits!"</p>

<p>He tossed aside his professorial
robes. Under them Cydwick Ohms
wore an ancient and bizarre costume:
black riding boots, highly
polished and trimmed in silver;
wool chaps; a wide, jewel-studded
belt with an immense buckle; a
brightly checked shirt topped by a
blazing red bandana. Briskly, he
snapped a tall ten-gallon hat on
his head, and stepped to the Time
Door.</p>

<p>Gripping an ebony handle, he
tugged upward. The huge metal
door oiled slowly back. "Time,"
said Cydwick Ohms simply, gesturing
toward the gray nothingness
beyond the door.</p>

<p>The reporters and photographers
surged forward, notebooks and
cameras at the ready. "What if the
door swings shut after you're
gone?" one of them asked.</p>

<p>"A groundless fear, boy," assured
Ohms. "I have seen to it that
the Time Door can never be closed.
And now&mdash;good-bye, gentlemen.
Or, to use the proper colloquialism&mdash;<i>so
long, hombres!</i>"</p>

<p>Ohms bowed from the waist,
gave his ten-gallon hat a final tug,
and took a single step forward.</p>

<p>And did <i>not</i> disappear.</p>

<p>He stood, blinking. Then he
swore, beat upon the unyielding
wall of grayness with clenched fists,
and fell back, panting, to his desk.</p>

<p>"I've failed!" he moaned in a
lost voice. "The C. Cydwick Ohms
Time Door is a botch!" He buried
his head in trembling hands.</p>

<p>The reporters and photographers
began to file out.</p>

<p>Suddenly the professor raised his
head. "<i>Listen!</i>" he warned.</p>

<p>A slow rumbling, muted with
distance, emanated from the dense
grayness of the Time Door. Faint
yips and whoopings were distinct
above the rumble. The sounds grew
steadily&mdash;to a thousand beating
drums&mdash;to a rolling sea of thunder!</p>

<p>Shrieking, the reporters and photographers
scattered for the stairs.</p>

<p>Ah, another knotty problem to be
solved, mused Professor Cydwick
Ohms, swinging, with some difficulty,
onto one of three thousand
Texas steers stampeding into the
laboratory.</p>
